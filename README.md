# TempLogger_8051_Project
8051_TempLogger_I2C_SPI_LCD A temperature data logger system built using the 8051 microcontroller. It reads temperature data via an SPI-based ADC, displays the current reading on an LCD, and stores historical data in an EEPROM using I2C. The system supports interrupt-based retrieval of the last 5 logged temperature values.
